<h1>The Old Astronomer</h1> 
<h2>Sarah Williams (1837-1868)</h2>

<main>
<p>
Reach me down my Tycho Brahe, I would know him when we meet,<br>
When I share my later science, sitting humbly at his feet;<br>
He may know the law of all things, yet be ignorant of how<br>
We are working to completion, working on from then to now.
  </p>
  
<p>
Pray remember that I leave you all my theory complete,<br>
Lacking only certain data for your adding, as is meet,<br>
And remember men will scorn it, 'tis original and true,<br>
And the obliquy of newness may fall bitterly on you.
  </p>

<p>
But, my pupil, as my pupil you have learned the worth of scorn,<br>
You have laughed with me at pity, we have joyed to be forlorn,<br>
What for us are all distractions of men's fellowship and wiles;<br>
What for us the Goddess Pleasure with her meretricious smiles.
  </p>

<p>
You may tell that German College that their honor comes too late,<br>
But they must not waste repentance on the grizzly savant's fate.<br>
Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light;<br>
I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.
  </p>

  <p>
What, my boy, you are not weeping? You should save your eyes for sight;<br>
You will need them, mine observer, yet for many another night.<br>
I leave none but you, my pupil, unto whom my plans are known.<br>
You "have none but me," you murmur, and I "leave you quite alone"?
  </p>

<p>
Well then, kiss me, -- since my mother left her blessing on my brow,<br>
There has been a something wanting in my nature until now;<br>
I can dimly comprehend it, -- that I might have been more kind,<br>
Might have cherished you more wisely, as the one I leave behind.
  </p>

<p>
I "have never failed in kindness"? No, we lived too high for strife,<br>
Calmest coldness was the error which has crept into our life;<br>
But your spirit is untainted, I can dedicate you still<br>
To the service of our science: you will further it? you will!
  </p>

<p>
There are certain calculations I should like to make with you,<br>
To be sure that your deductions will be logical and true;<br>
And remember, "Patience, Patience," is the watchword of a sage,<br>
Not to-day nor yet to-morrow can complete a perfect age.
  </p>

<p>
I have sown, like Tycho Brahe, that a greater man may reap;<br>
But if none should do my reaping, 'twill disturb me in my sleep<br>
So be careful and be faithful, though, like me, you leave no name;<br>
See, my boy, that nothing turn you to the mere pursuit of fame.
  </p>

<p>
I must say Good-bye, my pupil, for I cannot longer speak;<br>
Draw the curtain back for Venus, ere my vision grows too weak:<br>
It is strange the pearly planet should look red as fiery Mars,<br>
God will mercifully guide me on my way amongst the stars.
